Data Camp: Network Analysis

Predictive Analytics using Networked Data in R

Customer churning – ‘defection’

# Inspect edgeList
head(edgeList)

# Construct the igraph object
network <- graph_from_data_frame(edgeList, directed = FALSE)

# View your igraph object
network


# Labeled networks and network learning:

Churn prediction in social networks:

![Churn](../Input/churn.PNG)

The relational neighbor classifer:

Linked nodes have a propensity to  have a similar classifier
![relational-neighbor](../Input/relational-neighbor.PNG)

```{r}

# Inspect the customers dataframe
# head(customers)

# Count the number of churners and non-churners
# table(customers$churn)

# Add a node attribute called churn
# V(network)$churn <- customers$churn

# Visualize the network
# plot(network, vertex.label = NA, edge.label = NA, edge.color = 'black', vertex.size = 2)

```

# Add color:
```{r}
# Add a node attribute called color
# V(network)$color <- V(network)$churn

# Change the color of churners to red and non-churners to white
# V(network)$color <- gsub("1", "red", V(network)$color) 
# V(network)$color <- gsub("0", "white", V(network)$color)

# Plot the network
# plot(network, vertex.label = NA, edge.label = NA, edge.color = "black", vertex.size = 2)
```

# visualizing churners only
```{r}
# Create a subgraph with only churners
# churnerNetwork <- induced_subgraph(network, v = V(network)[which(V(network)$churn == 1)])
                    
# Plot the churner network 
# plot(churnerNetwork, vertex.label = NA, vertex.size = 2)

```

# Relational Neighbor Classifier:
```{r}
# Compute the churn probabilities
# churnProb <- ChurnNeighbors / (ChurnNeighbors + NonChurnNeighbors)

# Find who is most likely to churn
# mostLikelyChurners <- which(churnProb == max(churnProb))

# Extract the IDs of the most likely churners
# customers$id[mostLikelyChurners]
```


# Unsupervised learning:

Splitting the data into Training (60-80%) vs. test (40-20%) sets

The observations in teh dataset are not independent and identifcally distributed (iid)

Probabilistic relational neighbor classifier (instead of each node being assigned to a classifier, a probability is assigned to the node)

Collective inferencing is a procedure to simultaneously label nodes in interconnected data to reduce classification error.

```{r}
# Load the pROC package and data
library(pROC)
load("Nex132.RData")

# Compute the AUC
auc(customers$churn, as.vector(churnProb))

# Write a for loop to update the probabilities
for(i in 1:10){
 churnProb <- as.vector((AdjacencyMatrix %*% churnProb) / neighbors)
}

# Compute the AUC again
auc(customers$churn, as.vector(churnProb))
```
